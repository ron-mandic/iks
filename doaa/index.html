              I gaze at the water stretching out before me, and memories flood my mind. 
              Every day, I hear the horrifying stories of people fleeing for their lives,
              crossing dangerous borders and hostile seas.
              But there is one story that keeps me awake at night, and that is my story.

              I am Doaa, a Syrian refugee, 19 years old at the time. I led a difficult life in Egypt, working for meager wages. 
              My father constantly thought about his once-successful business in Syria that was destroyed by a bomb.
              The war that had driven us here was still raging into its fourth year. And the community that once welcomed us had become suspicious of us.
              One day, men on motorcycles tried to abduct me.

              But I was also full of hope because I was in love with another Syrian refugee named Bassem. 
              He too struggled in Egypt and said to me, "Let's go to Europe to seek asylum and safety. 
              I will work, and you can study—a chance for a new life." He asked my father for my hand in marriage.

              But we knew that to reach Europe, we had to risk our lives by crossing the Mediterranean 
              and placing our hands in the hands of notorious smugglers known for their cruelty.

          I had a terrible fear of the water, unable to swim. 
          It was August, and already 2,000 people had died trying to cross the Mediterranean. 
          But I knew a friend who had made it to Northern Europe, and I thought, "Maybe we can make it too."

          So I asked my parents if we could go, and after a painful discussion, they agreed. 
          Bassem paid all his savings—$2,500 per person—to the smugglers. One Saturday morning, the call came, and we were taken by bus to a beach where hundreds of people had gathered. 
          We were then transferred onto small boats and onto an old fishing boat. Five hundred of us crowded onto this boat, 300 below deck, 200 on top.

          There were Syrians, Palestinians, Africans, Muslims, and Christians. 
          One hundred children were on board, including Sandra, the little six-year-old, and Masa, 18 months old. 
          There were families on this boat, pressed shoulder to shoulder, foot to foot. I sat huddled, legs drawn up, pressed close to Bassem.
          On the second day at sea, we were worried and seasick from the rough waters.

          Another ship, a fast boat, approached us. Men with guns threatened us, shooting into the air and causing the boat to capsize. 
          Panic broke out. People fell into the water, screaming for help. I could only think of Bassem; I held onto him, but the bullets hit us.
          He sank below the surface, and I lost sight of him.

          I had no time to mourn; I had to fight for my own life. I held onto a child's life ring as the water tossed me around. 
          I saw Sandra, the little girl, desperately struggling for her life. I managed to swim to her and tied her to my life ring.

          Then I spotted Masa, the tiny baby, helplessly floating in the water. 
          Without hesitation, I brought her to me. The sea was cruel, and cold and exhaustion nearly drained my last strength. But I clung to Sandra and Masa, refusing to let them go. 
          I knew I had to fight for them.

          We drifted for four days in the open sea, surrounded by death and despair. 
          The sun burned our skin, thirst tormented us, and the cold seeped into our bones. 
          But I couldn't give up, not for myself and not for these innocent children. 
          I pleaded with the heavens to save us.

          They saw us, they heard us. They came to our rescue.

          I wanted the world to understand that we are not just statistics but people with dreams and hopes.
